## Course Overview

The 1430CPSC Class focuses on learning the fundamentals of C++ programming. Throughout this course, you will gain a solid understanding of key concepts such as pointers, abstract data types (ADTs) like linked lists, stacks, and queues, as well as classes, dynamic integer arrays, and memory management techniques.

## Topics Covered

The course covers the following topics:

- Pointers and Memory Management
- Abstract Data Types (ADTs)
  - Linked Lists
  - Stack
  - Queue
- Classes and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Dynamic Integer Arrays
- File Input/Output
- Algorithm Design and Analysis

## Projects

The repository includes the following projects:

1. **p1:** TicTacToe
   - Description: A Tic-Tac-Toe game where the user can define the size of the board. The implementation utilizes classes to handle the game logic.
   - Files: `p1.cpp`

2. **p2:** ASCII Text Editor
   - Description: An ASCII text editor implemented using dynamic arrays. It allows users to edit, save, and load text files.
   - Files: `p2.cpp`

3. **p3:** TODO List
   - Description: A simple TODO list manager implemented using linked lists. It allows users to add, remove, and manage tasks.
   - Files: `p3.cpp`

4. **p4:** Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) Calculator
   - Description: A Reverse Polish Notation calculator that evaluates mathematical expressions using stacks and queues. It supports basic operations.
   - Files: `p4.cpp`
